## Description
This is a simple front end react memory game.
The game objective is to click on as many new characters from the show supernatural as possible and avoiding to click the same character twice.
The game is over if you either:
1. Click an already clicked character twice or if you,
2. Successfully click all 10 characters.

## What I learned
1. The importance of conditional rendering.
2. How to use Framer motion and react-parallax-tilt.
3. How to use useEffect and useRef.
